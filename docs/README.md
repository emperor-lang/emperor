# Emperor ðŸ‘‘

_A statically typed, automatically-threaded, imperative language with purity and functional constructs._

## Description

This is the compiler for the [`emperor`](https://emperor-lang.github.io/emperor/index.html) language which is designed to be run from the command-line.
The CLI of this project is specified in [`emperor.json`][emperor.json] which conforms to [`argspec`][argspec].

The language itself is intended to have similarities to functional languages, including an expressive type-system.
However, it is intended to allow the user to explicitly manipulate state with a notion of both _pure_ and _impure_ functions.
It is possible to use local state within functions however global state and other side-effects may only be used from _impure_ functions.

Dynamic scope is used for variables but static scoping is used for functions.

## Usage

The emperor compiler may be called as follows.

```bash
emperor -i ./program.e -o ./program
```

Single programs may be translated in to C and compiled separately along with other C files as follows.

```bash
emperor -c -O3 -i ./program.e -o ./program.e.c
gcc $(emperor-setup --cflags) â€¦ ./program.e.c â€¦ $(emperor-setup --libs)
```
