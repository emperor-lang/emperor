## Pull Request Process

When authoring a PR, please use the template provided.

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Update `emperor.json` to reflect these changes where applicable.
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
5. You may merge the Pull Request once you have signed off with two members of the `emperor-lang` team. (Note that for team-members we only require one other member as this is quite a small project at the moment.)
<!-- 5. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you. -->
